DESCRIPTION = """
⚠️ Please use Firefox or Chrome browser for this experiment, as Safari have been reported to have some issues.

👋 Welcome! This experiment should take around 20 minutes of your time. Please use the device with a big screen if you
can, it would be easier to do the experiment.

ℹ️ This experiment is completely anonymous, and all the data collected will be used for the research purposes. You can
stop participating in this experiment at any moment and there will be no data submitted as long as you don't see the
final message.

📢 Please read the following instructions carefully
and **don't reload the page** until you are finished, or you will lose your progress.

📃 You will be presented with a reference track and 5 playlists of 4 tracks that are suggested based on the reference
track. **You don't need to listen to each track for the full duration**, by default you would be presented with
15-second segment from each track. You can continue listening or skip around by using the controls of the audio player
to get a better understanding if you feel that 15 seconds is not enough. However,
please listen to the reference track and each track from the playlist **just enough** to understand the nature of
each track.

⚠️ If the audio widgets are too short for the controls to be comfortably used, please zoom out the webpage with the
help of your browser.

🎯 There are 4 reference tracks in total, your overall progress is indicated by the progress bar under these
instructions.

⏳ Please **don't think too much** about the answers or spend too much time on each track, answer intuitively by
adjusting the rating to that which feels right after familiarizing yourself with every track from a playlist.
Don't forget that there are no wrong answers.

⭐ For each playlist,
please rate its similarity **to the reference track** on the 4-point scale from _"not similar"_ to _"very similar"_
as if the playlist is presented to you in the following context:

### If you liked how this track sounds, you might like these other tracks

END_MESSAGE = """
### Thanks for participating!

Please answer a few background questions that should only take 3 minutes of your time:
